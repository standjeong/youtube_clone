        "description": "Beware the promise of gifts. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power returns August 29 on Prime Video.\n\nAbout The Rings of Power Season 2: Sauron has returned. Cast out by Galadriel, without army or ally, the rising Dark Lord must now rely on his own cunning to rebuild his strength and oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, which will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will. Building on Season 1’s epic scope and ambition, Season 2 of Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power plunges even its most beloved and vulnerable characters into a rising tide of darkness, challenging each to find their place in a world that is increasingly on the brink of calamity. Elves and dwarves, orcs and men, wizards and Harfoots… as friendships are strained and kingdoms begin to fracture, the forces of good will struggle ever more valiantly to hold on to what matters to them most of all… each other.\n\n» Watch The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power on Prime Video: https://amzn.to/3q5uWkN\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/PrimeVideoSubscribe\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

          "description": "Beware the promise of gifts. The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power returns August 29 on Prime Video.\n\nAbout The Rings of Power Season 2: Sauron has returned. Cast out by Galadriel, without army or ally, the rising Dark Lord must now rely on his own cunning to rebuild his strength and oversee the creation of the Rings of Power, which will allow him to bind all the peoples of Middle-earth to his sinister will. Building on Season 1’s epic scope and ambition, Season 2 of Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power plunges even its most beloved and vulnerable characters into a rising tide of darkness, challenging each to find their place in a world that is increasingly on the brink of calamity. Elves and dwarves, orcs and men, wizards and Harfoots… as friendships are strained and kingdoms begin to fracture, the forces of good will struggle ever more valiantly to hold on to what matters to them most of all… each other.\n\n» Watch The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power on Prime Video: https://amzn.to/3q5uWkN\n» SUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/PrimeVideoSubscribe\n \nAbout Prime Video:\nWant to watch it now?

During its first drag-strip launch, the rear-drive mid-engined monster roared through the quarter-mile in under 10 seconds. During its first lap at GM's Milford Proving Grounds, it posted a faster top speed than the previous-gen ZR1. At Germany's famous Nürburgring racetrack, all four Corvette test drivers eclipsed 200 mph on their first laps. And the firsts don't stop there. The 2025 Chevy Corvette ZR1 is also the first turbocharged Vette and the first production model to produce 1064(!) horsepower.\n\nSubscribe to Car and Driver http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoCARandDRIVER\n\n00:00 Going 200-plus mph\n00:53 The ZTK Track Performance Package\n01:32 1064 hp, twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8\n03:17 Turbo boost management\n03:58 Torque\n05:17 \"We've burned up a lot of dynos.\" \n06:16 The exhaust generates thrust (and flames) \n07:52 Air inlets and management\n10:35 Top speed and quarter mile\n11:35 Carbon ceramic brake rotors and carbon fiber wheels\n14:59 ZR1 Convertible\n17:54 Differences in ride quality \n19:00 Sacrificing the front storage area\n20:03 A window for the engine \n20:40 Coupe vs convertible performance differences\n21:43 Tadge Juechter on retiring and working on the first ZR1\n23:30 ZR1 versus powerful EVs\n24:01 80 mph to 200 mph and back \n25:23 Convertible operation\n26:54 Availability",

          "description": "Read more: https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a61692733/2025-chevrolet-corvette-zr1-revealed/\n\nThe 2025 Chevy Corvette ZR1 has a 1064-hp twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8, making it by far the most powerful Vette to ever reach production.\n\nThe ZR1's LT7 engine also makes it the first turbocharged Corvette, and its myriad upgrades distinguish it from the Z06's naturally aspirated LT6.\n\nWith an estimated top speed of 215-plus mph, an available aero kit that nets up to 1200 pounds of downforce, and other exotic bits, the C8 ZR1 is set up to slay supercars.\n\nThe GM engineers who developed the new C8 Corvette ZR1 said it was obvious early on that they were dealing with something special. During its first drag-strip launch, the rear-drive mid-engined monster roared through the quarter-mile in under 10 seconds. During its first lap at GM's Milford Proving Grounds, it posted a faster top speed than the previous-gen ZR1. At Germany's famous Nürburgring racetrack, all four Corvette test drivers eclipsed 200 mph on their first laps. And the firsts don't stop there. The 2025 Chevy Corvette ZR1 is also the first turbocharged Vette and the first production model to produce 1064(!) horsepower.\n\nSubscribe to Car and Driver http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoCARandDRIVER\n\n00:00 Going 200-plus mph\n00:53 The ZTK Track Performance Package\n01:32 1064 hp, twin-turbo 5.5-liter V-8\n03:17 Turbo boost management\n03:58 Torque\n05:17 \"We've burned up a lot of dynos.\" \n06:16 The exhaust generates thrust (and flames) \n07:52 Air inlets and management\n10:35 Top speed and quarter mile\n11:35 Carbon ceramic brake rotors and carbon fiber wheels\n14:59 ZR1 Convertible\n17:54 Differences in ride quality \n19:00 Sacrificing the front storage area\n20:03 A window for the engine \n20:40 Coupe vs convertible performance differences\n21:43 Tadge Juechter on retiring and working on the first ZR1\n23:30 ZR1 versus powerful EVs\n24:01 80 mph to 200 mph and back \n25:23 Convertible operation\n26:54 Availability"
